A fun little project where I experiment with using multiple APIs, mostly OpenAI and Ollama's options. 
By leveraging different APIs, I can experiment with different LLMs and get a feel for their peculiarities and best use cases. 
In this project, I will be applying this process to a hypothetical philosophical discussion between two or more philosopher bots. 
The bots will debate various topics, emulating famous philosophers' ideas and styles of argumentation. 
The aim is to create a dynamic and engaging way to explore philosophical concepts through AI-driven dialogue while experimenting
 with the strengths and limitations of both platforms.
